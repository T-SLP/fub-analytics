Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\n[2026-01-19 RECEIVED] The 56 acres does not have an ace amount the utilities come up to the property that's next door to the 56 acres that you would have to run them from his pole to you establishing a pole or under\nNo water is up there so you would have to dig a well but you're on top of the mountain so you should hit water at some point\nI would do total electric because it would be hard for a propane gas company to bring the propane in on top of the mountain\n[2026-01-19 RECEIVED] Yes, there is a road up to the property. It is a county road, but it is not maintained in the way that it should be and the reason they do not maintain it is because they say that deer hunters four wheelers they kind of go through and mess up the road, but I do wish they would fix the area where you go straight up the hill to get to my property, but it's doable, but you do need a four-wheel-drive or a vehicle that sets a little bit higher off the ground\n[2026-01-19 RECEIVED] So there you go, buddy come up with your number\n[2026-01-19 RECEIVED] I already had several offers in with numbers, so make sure you make it high enough that it would make me think about it\n[2026-01-19 SENT] Thank you for the information.

Do you have a price in mind for this tract?\n[2026-01-19 RECEIVED] I've had an offer of over $100,000 for the 56 acres actually the tax base says it's worth 120 to 130 something thousand and we know that they are lower than what it's really worth but we might be able to make a deal if you can be somewhere close\n[2026-01-19 SENT] Got it. Thank you! I appreciate your time. My manager will keep in touch. Have a great day!",

His offer for the 17 acres is about $10,000 an acre, a little over $10,000 an acre. That may be within striking distance, but this is a landlocked property, so we need to understand the road access. Is there deeded legal access back to the property? And then is there physical access, like a road, one can actually drive down? I see a road-looking path on the parcel boundary, but it looks overgrown in the satellite photo. This one isn't worth exploring much further until the access situation is understood."

Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\n[2026-01-07 RECEIVED] Front road access.  Electric i available there is no restrictions far as I know, and as far as I know there is no easements on the deed. Granpa did let this guy that owns property behind it go across him but he also has different places he can go in too. Im assuming it was word of mouth not in the deed. It does have a spring on it water flows through it Year round never goes dry\n[2026-01-07 SENT] Thank you for the information. You're also the sole owner, right?\n[2026-01-07 RECEIVED] Correct\n[2026-01-07 SENT] I'm also curious, we want to make sure that we can meet your goals and expectations about the price. Do you have a price in mind for this tract?\n[2026-01-07 RECEIVED] Yes i will sale it for 1.2 right now without putting it up on the market. I was told I could get 1.5  or more for it. I just haven't really tried or been in a hurry to sale it.\n[2026-01-08 SENT] Got it. Based on our conversation, I'd like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss on this.

        "body": "@Dante Hernandez you need to dial the main mobile number that Iris texted ending in 0956. \n\nLook at comps on this one. Filter everything above 80 acres in the county. There's a lot of listed on-market competition at $2,500 an acre. She has a nice property, but I have a hard time thinking she would get any more than $3,000 an acre for it. And I wouldn't be surprised if she got less due to the competition on the market. I really like this property from a subdivide potential. If we could cut it into 40 to 60 acre tracks, I think the price per acre could be driven up to $5,000 to $6,000 an acre. Making it compelling for us to pursue. \n\nEngage this lead and start to build a relationship. Big deal potential. See if you can gain some trust talking about the comps you see in the area. Don't tell her she's wrong but nicely imply that what you see on the market makes you question whether or not she would get $1.5M on the market."
