Confirm (likely continue holding while trying to figure out what to do with 99 acres total).\n\n---\n\n**Decision Makers**\n\u27a4 **Primary Decision Maker:** Nicole (executor of the estate).\n\u27a4 **Other Decision Makers:** Other family members/heirs implied \u2014 Unclear / ?

Seller is executor of estate and lives in Brooklyn, NY. Our tools currently show ~60k market value; plan is to explore subdividing/resell to potentially justify a higher purchase price than raw value. Seller referenced a nearby sale of similar acreage at ~165k within the last few months (approx. 10 miles away) as anchor for expectations."

        "body": "MESSAGING HISTORY\n[2025-11-18 SENT] Hi James, I'm Iris from SLP, curious about your 85.0 acres in Shelby County. Could we discuss potential opportunities?\n[2025-11-18 RECEIVED] It's only 80 acres now. I subdivided and sold the house with a 5 acre tract. Remaining road frontage is about 3-400 feet. 2 barns and a cattle feeding structure remain. Fenced and cross fenced for cattle. I have a hunting lease that expires at the end of this calendar year. I have interest from other parties. It's very valuable due to its proximity to Shelbyville and interstate 64.\n[2025-11-18 SENT] Got it.Let me get a few details from you so we can build out a proposal.\nCan you tell me more about this property? Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\n[2025-11-18 RECEIVED] Yes, there is road access. Yes, all utilities available. Water/electricity/gas.  The only easement I am aware of is a utility easement specific to a buried natural gas pipeline, Which is a plus since it supplies natural gas to the property whereas most rural property owners do not have access to natural gas in Shelby County.\n[2025-11-18 SENT] Thank you for the information. You're also the sole owner, right?\n[2025-11-18 RECEIVED] Yes, my wife and myself\n[2025-11-18 SENT] I'm also curious, we want to make sure that we can meet your goals and expectations about the price. Do you have a price in mind for this tract?\n[2025-11-18 RECEIVED] $1.2 million\n[2025-11-18 SENT] Got it. Based on our conversation, I'd like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss on this. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?\n[2025-11-18 RECEIVED] Afternoon\n[2025-11-18 SENT] Perfect. Do you also have an email address just in case?",

          "note": "**Property Context**\n\u27a4 **Length of Ownership:** Owned for ~25\u201327 years *(implied from \u201cmust be over 25, maybe 26, 27 years now\u201d \u2013 exact year not provided)*.\n\u27a4 **How did they come about obtaining the property:** Purchased as an investment/recreational asset ~25+ years ago *(implied; exact purchase details not provided \u2014 ask next call for more background).*\n\u27a4 **Current Use / Past Use:**\n\u2022 Currently: Vacant, unimproved wooded land with standing/mature timber; preserved primarily for natural beauty and wildlife; no structures on the property.\n\u2022 Past: Has had hunting leases on it before; frequently gets inquiries from people wanting to hunt there; maintained as preserved timber/recreational land rather than logging.\n\u27a4 **Frequency of Visits/Use:** Not provided \u2014 ask next call (how often he or others currently go out, especially for hunting/recreation).\n\u27a4 **Other unique/special circumstances:**\n\u2022 50-acre continuous lot (vacant land) in Floyd County; opposite side of the road from a separate 33.8-acre parcel he owns but is **not** selling.\n\u2022 Property is unimproved with mature standing timber; seller has deliberately not sold to logging companies to preserve the look of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\u2022 Elevation runs roughly from ~2,150 ft to ~2,350 ft and is south-facing; makes for very good hunting and strong wildlife habitat.\n\u2022 Large neighboring tract (~600 acres) wraps around/near the 50 acres; used only for recreation/second home by a NC family, which further supports wildlife habitat and \u201cin-nature\u201d feel.\n\u2022 Within commuting distance to Roanoke and Blacksburg (Virginia Tech); about 4\u20135 miles to small convenience stores; airports and full services available in those cities.\n\n**House Details (if present)**\n\u27a4 **Bedrooms/Baths:** Not applicable \u2014 vacant land; no structures.\n\u27a4 **Square Footage:** Not applicable \u2014 vacant land.\n\u27a4 **Age:** Not applicable \u2014 vacant land.\n\u27a4 **Condition:** Land is unimproved timberland; no known development, utilities, or structures on-site; condition specifics (road access quality, internal trails/roads, etc.) not provided \u2014 ask next call.\n\u27a4 **Other Notable Improvements:** None; no structures or improvements mentioned beyond standing timber and general access from road \u2014 ask next call if any existing woods roads or cleared areas.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation (\u201cThree Whys\u201d)**\n\u27a4 **Why sell now?** It\u2019s an asset he has held for ~25+ years; acknowledges that at some point \u201cwe liquidate our assets\u201d and he\u2019s willing to talk about selling now while values are strong and there is high enthusiasm for mountain land. No immediate pressure, more long-term asset liquidation.\n\u27a4 **Why haven\u2019t they sold before?** Enjoys the Blue Ridge Mountains and the way the land looks; preserved timber instead of logging; uses it as long-term investment/recreational asset. Land values have been rising and recently strong comps, so he has held waiting for the right value.\n\u27a4 **Why not list with a realtor?** Not mentioned \u2014 ask next call. *(Currently open to investor purchase and references being \u201cin the business\u201d and collaborating on projects.)*\n\u27a4 **Future plans if not sold:** No urgent need to sell; will continue holding as an asset (with mature timber and recreation value) and is under no pressure \u2014 \u201csooner is better,\u201d but no deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Makers**\n\u27a4 **Primary Decision Maker:** Timothy Burke.\n\u27a4 **Other Decision Makers:** Not provided \u2014 ask next call (he occasionally says \u201cwe,\u201d so clarify if spouse/partner or business associates also need to approve).\n\u27a4 **Decision-Making Process:** Very data and market-driven; compares to recent nearby sales (e.g., ~20 acres at just over $4,000/acre ~3 years ago and another nearby parcel at ~$10,000/acre ~1.5\u20132 years ago). Will review offers based on market comps and his view of strong demand for mountain land; no urgency but open to serious discussions at his price.\n\n---\n\n**Financials & Price**\n\u27a4 **Price Objective:** Asking **$300,000** for the 50-acre parcel (i.e., ~$6,000/acre). Basis: informal perc success, mature standing timber, recent comps of ~$4,000/acre and ~$10,000/acre nearby, strong demand for mountain land, and desirable south-facing, wildlife-rich setting. Negotiability not firmly defined, but tone suggests he\u2019s anchored fairly strongly to $300k as justified by comps.\n\n---\n\n**Seller Engagement**\n\u27a4 **Response Quality:** High; corrected parcel confusion immediately, clearly described the right parcel, provided ownership timeline, pricing rationale, comps, and qualitative value points (elevation, timber, wildlife, neighboring 600 acres, access to Roanoke/Blacksburg).\n\u27a4 **Communication Style:** Professional, articulate, analytical; \u201cin the business\u201d and used to collaborating on land projects; calm, reasonable, and open to discussion while clearly confident in the property\u2019s value.\n\n---\n\n**Qualification & Priority**\n\u27a4 **Lead Rating:**\n? MEDIUM PRIORITY (Some positive indicators but mixed signals)\n\n\u27a4 **Justification:** Strong, high-quality property with mature timber, good recreational appeal, proximity to larger cities, and strong engagement from an experienced seller. However, price expectation is high at $300k (~$6k/acre) and he has no pressure to sell, framing it as long-term asset liquidation. Good candidate if underwriting can support near his price, but limited room for deep discounting; viability hinges on how close Synergy can get to his ask.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps / Follow-Up**\n\u27a4 **Next Follow-up Scheduled:** Madeleine to call back next week around the same general time to confirm whether underwriting can meet or approach his $300k asking price (no specific date/time set; seller said he\u2019s in and out and can return calls).\n\u27a4 **Action Items:**\n\u2022 Property analysis / CMA\n\u2022 Prepare initial offer range\n\u2022 Research comparable sales\n\u2022 Address specific concerns: Confirm exact parcel ID and boundaries of the 50-acre tract (since the 33.8-acre parcel is not for sale); quantify nearby comp sales (20-acre at just over $4k/acre and parcel at ~$10k/acre) and see how his $6k/acre ask fits; verify informal perc assumptions and any access/utility details; clarify whether any conservation/logging constraints or preferences exist.\n\u2022 Other: Note strong hunting/recreational value, adjacency to ~600-acre recreational tract, south-facing slope, and proximity to Roanoke/Blacksburg in underwriting. Be prepared to discuss both investment perspective and potential exit strategies that justify/approach his $300k price point.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\u27a4 50-acre continuous, unimproved, timbered parcel in Floyd County; opposite side of the road from a separate 33.8-acre piece he is **not** selling. Informal perc test indicates it perks, but nothing is recorded with the county. Property has mature timber throughout, 2,150\u20132,350 ft elevation, south-facing, strong wildlife/hunting appeal, and adjacent/nearby ~600-acre recreational tract owned by an NC family. Within commuting distance of Roanoke and Blacksburg (airports, large population centers), yet still rural with the closest retail being small convenience stores ~4\u20135 miles away. Seller is experienced in land projects, views the parcel as a preserved asset, and is open to liquidating at what he considers fair market value (~$300k)."

          "note": "**Property Context**\n\u27a4 **Length of Ownership:** Canada Creek ~20 years; Dry Hollow ~7 years.\n\u27a4 **How did they come about obtaining the property:** Not provided \u2014 ask next call. (Canada Creek was transferred into his name by his wife, but original acquisition method not discussed.)\n\u27a4 **Current Use / Past Use:**\n\u2022 Currently: Rural land, mostly unused by seller; has not visited either property in over a year *(implied)*.\n\u2022 Past: Not provided \u2014 ask next call (no details on prior use such as farming, hunting, timber, etc.).\n\u27a4 **Frequency of Visits/Use:** Has not been to either property in over a year; overall very infrequent visits.\n\u27a4 **Other unique/special circumstances:**\n\u2022 Two parcels being sold together: ~96.8 acres on Dry Hollow Road and ~8.3 acres on Canada Creek Road.\n\u2022 8.3-acre Canada Creek parcel: Road frontage on Canada Creek Road; city water and blacktop streets; described as a \u201cpretty good little spot\u201d at/near \u201clong road bridge.\u201d No perk test done, but seller is confident it will perk.\n\u2022 96.8-acre Dry Hollow parcel: Access from a county road (Dry Hollow Road) on one side and a private road on the other, giving two entrances. Electric lines visible from the property; has a natural spring providing water.\n\u2022 Area is experiencing in-migration (people moving in from California, Maine, etc.); seller believes land values are rising and will \u201cshoot completely out of control.\u201d\n\n**House Details (if present)**\n\u27a4 **Bedrooms/Baths:** Not applicable \u2014 no house or structures described on either parcel.\n\u27a4 **Square Footage:** Not applicable.\n\u27a4 **Age:** Not applicable.\n\u27a4 **Condition:** Vacant land; no structure condition discussed \u2014 ask next call if any old buildings, barns, or other improvements exist.\n\u27a4 **Other Notable Improvements:** Spring on 96.8-acre tract; city water and paved road (blacktop street) on 8.3-acre tract. No other improvements mentioned \u2014 ask next call.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation (\u201cThree Whys\u201d)**\n\u27a4 **Why sell now?** Seller is 77 years old and finds it difficult to take care of everything; age and ability to manage properties are key drivers.\n\u27a4 **Why haven\u2019t they sold before?** Believes his prices are fair and is willing to wait for the \u201cright buyer.\u201d Has had multiple offers over the years and has a stack of contracts but has not accepted because buyers would not meet his expectations.\n\u27a4 **Why not list with a realtor?** He is not planning to list; prefers to wait for the right direct buyer and has had many direct inquiries already.\n\u27a4 **Future plans if not sold:** Will continue to hold the properties and wait until the right person comes along at his price; confident property values will keep rising.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Makers**\n\u27a4 **Primary Decision Maker:** Donald Humble.\n\u27a4 **Other Decision Makers:** Spouse involved as gatekeeper/voice on initial part of call; appears supportive of his pricing stance \u2014 confirm level of decision-making authority next call.\n\u27a4 **Decision-Making Process:** Donald will think about the offer, revisit both properties (hasn\u2019t been there in over a year), talk to a few people, review other existing offers/contracts, and then decide. Strong price anchor; will only move if he feels price is fair.\n\n---\n\n**Financials & Price**\n\u27a4 **Price Objective:**\n\u2022 96.8-acre Dry Hollow parcel: Wants $150,000 *(transcript garbled as \u201c10,050,000\u201d but context + seller\u2019s comment that he believes it\u2019s reasonable for the time suggests ~$150k \u2014 Unclear / ? Confirm exact number).*\n\u2022 8.3-acre Canada Creek parcel: Previously offered $50,000 by another company; he references that as a benchmark and appears to expect similar or better.\n\u2022 Our offer (presented on the call): ~$100,000 total for both parcels (cash; 60\u201390 day close). Seller did not accept; says he needs to think about it.\n\n---\n\n**Seller Engagement**\n\u27a4 **Response Quality:** Good; answered questions on access, utilities, ownership length, and pricing clearly; shared context about the market and his age/limitations.\n\u27a4 **Communication Style:** Direct, old-school, and firm but polite. Very clear about his expectations and that he doesn\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s time if price isn\u2019t met. Uses land appreciation and demand narrative to justify his stance.\n\n---\n\n**Qualification & Priority**\n\u27a4 **Lead Rating:**\n? LOW PRIORITY (Minimal motivation or poor engagement)\n\n\u27a4 **Justification:** Seller is engaged and cooperative but has a strong price anchor (targeting ~150k + 50k vs our ~125k total offer) and openly states he\u2019ll wait as long as needed for the \u201cright buyer\u201d as values rise. He is not in a financial bind; motivation is age/maintenance, but urgency is low. He\u2019s unwilling to significantly discount and is content holding the properties, making a deal at our typical investment numbers unlikely in the near term.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps / Follow-Up**\n\u27a4 **Next Follow-up Scheduled:** No specific date/time set. Seller invited us to check back after he\u2019s visited the properties and thought about the offer; also open to receiving a contract by mail to review alongside his stack of other offers.\n\u27a4 **Action Items:**\n\u2022 Property analysis / CMA\n\u2022 Prepare initial offer range\n\u2022 Research comparable sales\n\u2022 Address specific concerns: Clarify his exact asking price for the 96.8-acre tract (confirm whether it is $150,000 or a different figure); confirm whether $50,000 is his firm target for the 8.3-acre tract; understand what, if anything, would make him consider a slightly lower number (timing, all-cash, quick close, etc.).\n\u2022 Other:\n\u2022 Mail a purchase contract and contact information to: **1959 Highway 1720, Monticello** (full city/state/ZIP to confirm in CRM).\n\u2022 Note that he has **no email** and only uses his house phone; follow-up must be by phone and/or physical mail.\n\u2022 When following up, ask if he has revisited the properties and whether conditions/market feedback have affected his price expectations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\u27a4 Two rural parcels: ~96.8 acres on Dry Hollow Road (county road + additional private access; two entrances; visible electric lines; spring on property) and ~8.3 acres on Canada Creek Road (city water, paved/blacktop street, good road frontage). Canada Creek tract has been owned ~20 years; Dry Hollow ~7 years. Seller\u2019s wife transferred Canada Creek into his name, triggering the \u201cnew\u201d sale record, but he has held it long-term. Donald is 77, finds upkeep difficult, and is \u201cold school\u201d (no email, only landline). He has a stack of prior offers and contracts from other buyers over the years and emphasizes that land values are climbing quickly due to in-migration. He is open to receiving our written offer but remains non-committal, wanting time to think, inspect the properties, and talk to others."

I think this property could sell for over $10,000 an acre. Please contact ASAP. \n\nI'd like us to have 90 days of due diligence and 120 days to close on this. That's the main thing to figure out. See if he has any flexibility on the price. If he does not, let's really push for a 120-day closing. I have an agent in this area I really trust that I would run this by immediately if we can get it under contract. \n\nWould also be good to understand where the legal easement is to the property. I see a couple options."

Txt Stop to End\r\n14784562268 09/10/2025 11:12:56 AM EDT\r\nIf you are looking for land only, this is not for you. The property is where my wife and I live so there are numerous outbuildings, garages, and a large workshop with hot and cold running water and bathroom facilities. The property also has a pond that is approximately one acre. The house is a 4 br - 3 bath mobile with an additional 320 sq foot added to the front. \n\nIn closing, I expect to pocket $250k for everything including tractors and implements. \n\nThank you for your interest\r\n16783703824 09/10/2025 1:10:35 PM EDT\r\nThank you for the information.

There are 2 wells on the property: one drilled and one bored. There are two electric service lines into the property: one 200 amp to the work shop and one 200 amp to the house. We have satellite tv and internet systems installed. The Emc recently added fiber optic to the supply poles so broadband is available but not installed. There are no restrictions attached to the property other than it is under a conservation easement for tax purposes.  \r\n16783703824 09/11/2025 9:58:03 AM EDT\r\nThank you for the information. Youre also the sole owner, right?\r\n14784562268 09/11/2025 11:12:23 AM EDT\r\nNo Im not. The property is in jtwos with my oldest daughter. \r\n16783703824 09/11/2025 1:28:20 PM EDT\r\nGot it. Thank you for clarifying. Im also curious, I know youre asking for an offer but we want to make sure that we can meet your goals and expectations about the price. Do you have a price in mind for this tract?\r\n14784562268 09/11/2025 2:07:41 PM EDT\r\nI wont give you a precise number as I really dont know what its worth and I dont want to leave any money on the table. I will say that anything below 225k will not be considered \r\n16783703824 09/11/2025 2:49:34 PM EDT\r\nGot it.

Mornings or afternoons?\r\n14784562268 09/11/2025 3:13:56 PM EDT\r\nRight now is not a good time. My wife and I have to travel to Macon for medical procedures tomorrow and Monday.

Lets discuss an offer if youre ready to sell. - Iris, Synergy Land Partners. Stop=End\r\n17069517757 08/26/2025 12:06:43 PM EDT\r\nHello, Iris.  I do not have the land listed on the market, but I would be willing to sell the 13.55 acres in Burke County for $70,460.00.  The parcel ID is 028 089C.  My land is not developed; therefore, no buildings or utilities are on it.  It requires a well and septic tank, and I did have a perc test done with favorable results.  The land is located in a rural residential area, with several houses in the area, so available utilities are not an issue.  The lot has an entry driveway from the highway, which is a part of the deeded land, and it has no easement or right-of-way rights to anyone but the land owner.  I have clear title to the land and the taxes are up to date.\r\n16783703824 08/26/2025 3:38:29 PM EDT\r\nThank you for the information. Youre also the sole owner, right?\r\n17069517757 08/26/2025 3:56:04 PM EDT\r\nNo, my wife and I own it.  \r\n16783703824 08/26/2025 3:57:57 PM EDT\r\nGot it. Based on our conversation, Id like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss an offer. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?\r\n17069517757 08/26/2025 4:22:36 PM EDT\r\nMornings are fine.\r\n16783703824 08/26/2025 4:24:51 PM EDT\r\nGreat! Do you also have an email address, just in case?",

Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\r\n13017882277 08/27/2025 1:53:26 PM EDT\r\nYes to road access on 2 well traveled roads and utilities. The gas line runs besides the road but Im not aware of any restrictions.\r\n14233500993 08/27/2025 5:52:36 PM EDT\r\nThank you for the information.

Let me also get a few details from you.\nCan you tell me more about this property? Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\r\n18657191984 08/18/2025 6:38:53 PM EDT\r\nAccess off of 2 county roads. Electric and water \n\nTransmission line easement. This is easily viewed on the McMinn county gis \n\nLet me know if you are interested \n\nThanks\r\n14234417673 08/19/2025 7:15:12 AM EDT\r\nThank you for the information. Youre also the sole owner, right?\r\n18657191984 08/19/2025 8:16:41 AM EDT\r\nYes. Me and my wife and probably a few hillbillies, skunks and possums!\r\n18657191984 08/19/2025 8:18:54 AM EDT\r\nIt is a beautiful piece of land with timber.  I do woodworking in my retirement so the timber could be negotiated if that is not something your purpose would include.\r\n18657191984 08/19/2025 8:19:33 AM EDT\r\nYou probably need to walk the property to appreciate it\r\n14234417673 08/19/2025 8:26:14 AM EDT\r\nOf course! It definitely sounds like a beautiful property. To help me get a clearer picture, could you also share a few details about the house?\n\nNumber of bedrooms\n\nNumber of baths (including half baths)\n\nSquare footage (in square feet)\n\nAge of the house (or year built)\n\nCurrent condition (livable, updated, needs repairs, structural issues, etc. - were not interested in houses that need major repairs)\n\nAny other notable features or improvements (pools, updates, solar panels, etc.)\r\n18657191984 08/19/2025 8:32:48 AM EDT\r\nI hope you have the right place...no house.\n\nI have 120 acres in Monroe county.  My farm home.  However, it aint for sale unless you want to spend some lottery winnings!\n\nI also have a home in Jackson Bend. Louisville.\n\nThis home is actually for sale.  We just put a new roof with 20 year labor and material warranty.  New geothermal system with 10 year full warranty.  K and l roofing and Pioneer heating and air.  Its a beautiful home...big!  I built it so its built like a bunker!\r\n14234417673 08/19/2025 8:58:34 AM EDT\r\nOh got it. Thank you for clarifying! I did look at the map to double check. Got it. Based on our conversation, Id like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss an offer. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?\r\n18657191984 08/19/2025 9:56:15 PM EDT\r\nAnytime.  A scheduled call is best because I dont always have my phone\r\n14234417673 08/20/2025 8:01:52 AM EDT\r\nGreat! Do you also have an email address, just in case? And my manager will just text you first to schedule a call if when youre available. I appreciate your time! Have a great day!\r\n14234417673 08/20/2025 8:11:31 AM EDT\r\nAlso, I wanted to clarify the 190 acres. I can only see on the map the 94 acres and the 83.5 acres, where is the other 12 acres can I get the address or parcel number?\r\n18657191984 08/20/2025 8:56:38 AM EDT\r\nMy mistake. Approximately 180.  I havent looked at the gis or deed in a while.  The numbers actually changed a little when they did the survey but not 12 acres!  Sorry about that.\n\nI do appreciate the feedback and the fact that you are thorough.\r\n14234417673 08/20/2025 9:37:10 AM EDT\r\nGot it. No problem. Thank you for confirming!",

We realistically could pursue this closer to $12,000 an acre for his two lots within the city limits of Carnesville. His acreage outside the city is just not worth that much because it cannot be developed and the southern parcel he owns outside the city is a pond and wetlands, so really nothing to be done with it. Try to strike up conversation with him and see how motivated he is. He is older. This would be a big project, long-term engagement, probably 6-12 months to close.

This will all be decided during 2026.\n[2026-01-05 SENT] Let me get a few details from you so we can build out a proposal.\nCan you tell me more about this property? Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\n[2026-01-05 RECEIVED] You have misunderstood what I said. I'm not ready to sell this property just yet, but will make a decision later this year depending chance of purchase for another property.  If that falls through I will build a house there.  The property then would not be for sale.\nIf I purchase another property I will need to sell the other property in order to buy the new property. So, in case you still would be interested, I am telling you the property has a well and septic field, and electric poles and lines for telephone and power.  There is also a driveway albeit some minor grading and gravel is needed as it hasn't been used for some time.  There are no encumbrances on the property.\n[2026-01-06 SENT] Thank you for the information. You're also the sole owner, right?\n[2026-01-06 RECEIVED] Yes\n[2026-01-06 SENT] I'm also curious, we want to make sure that we can meet your goals and expectations about the price. Do you have a price in mind for this tract?\n[2026-01-06 RECEIVED] A neighbor offered $150,000 for the property.\n[2026-01-06 SENT] Got it. Based on our conversation, I'd like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss on this. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?\n[2026-01-06 RECEIVED] Morning\n[2026-01-07 SENT] Perfect. Do you also have an email address just in case?",

The property has deep emotional value \u2014 Noel was raised there, and the land has been in the family for multiple generations.\nThey aren\u2019t actively trying to sell, but acknowledge they\u2019ll need to make decisions soon due to age. Their four children are expected to benefit from the eventual sale, though it\u2019s unclear if they are involved in current decision-making.\nKey Factor: The cell tower lease heavily impacts the seller\u2019s expectations. Noel believes the tower alone is worth \u201caround $500,000\u201d and \u201ca lot more than the farm.\u201d Our offer of $325,000 (land value only) was perceived as far too low.\nThe seller provided some details about the tower but little about the house or structures. He was direct and emotional on the call, emphasizing the tower's value and reacting strongly to the offer.\nMotivation: Low. They plan to sell \u201cone day,\u201d but no timeline and strong attachment to the property. A large price gap exists between our underwriting and the seller\u2019s expectations.\nNext Steps Needed:\n\u2022 Gather tower lease details (rent, renewals, ROFR, buyout, etc.)\n\u2022 Clarify whether the tower lease is included or carved out in any sale\n\u2022 Ask for additional property details (house, structures, condition, improvements)\n\u2022 Determine if the seller has a minimum price in mind\n\u2022 Set a follow-up strategy, acknowledging tower value to build credibility\nLead Rating: Low priority \u2014 low motivation, high emotional attachment, and a major valuation gap due to the tower lease."

They don't use the property and will be visiting this next week once weather clears up. They had a bad storm roll through apparently. There is a local farmer that leases the land, but he wasn't sure how much he pays. Noel is 88 and it's just him and his brother who are the decision makers. There is another interested party in the tower land and according from Noel that's what this guy buys. So FYI. We were at $315 up to 90 days and $350 for 120 days. But that was before the income producing part I. E Cell tower. Please let me know your thoughts."

Lets discuss an offer if youre ready to sell. - Iris, Synergy Land Partners. Stop=End\r\n18014208291 08/12/2025 10:16:06 AM EDT\r\nI own two of them.Neighboring lots. One has a house which Im sure you dont want. The other Im willing to consider any offers 210k or above. I have turned down two offers for 210k so Im not willing to take any lower then that \r\n14233500849 08/12/2025 10:35:30 AM EDT\r\nGot it. Thank you for letting me know so it has to be 210K above for the offer. Let me also get a few details from you so we can build out an offer.\nCan you tell me more about this property? Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\r\n18014208291 08/12/2025 10:39:55 AM EDT\r\nThe county road does go to it. It has no utilities , the electric is on the other property I own, but it is close and would not require an easement to get power to it.  There is no  easements on the property. And no restrictions. \nWater would need to be well, and they are hitting water at about 150 feet down.\r\n14233500849 08/12/2025 1:24:44 PM EDT\r\nThank you for the information. Youre also the sole owner, right?\r\n18014208291 08/12/2025 6:04:44 PM EDT\r\nYes\r\n14233500849 08/12/2025 6:09:45 PM EDT\r\nGot it. Based on our conversation, Id like to have our manager, Madeleine to give you a call to discuss an offer and we know your price. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?\r\n18014208291 08/12/2025 6:12:48 PM EDT\r\nI dont need a call you can make your offer over text or email. Rosie2662@gmail.com or send via mail 230 county road 83 Athens TN 37303 \n\nIf the offer is enough to further entertain then I will take a call to talk details\r\n14233500849 08/13/2025 8:50:57 AM EDT\r\nGot it. We will! I appreciate your time Ill let my manager know and she will be in touch. Have a great day!",

Property has been in the family for decades.\n\n- How did they come about obtaining the property: Inherited from father upon his death.\n\n- Current Use or what have they used it for in the past: No current use. Timber was cut 10\u201315 years ago. Now it\u2019s mostly overgrown with pine. His nephew hunts the adjacent land (turkey, deer, etc.).\n\n- Frequency of Visits/Use or last time they visited property: Hasn\u2019t visited in years. Lives 700 miles away.\n\n- Other unique things about the property and/or Special Circumstances:\nHas a 1-acre pond\nOld house from early 1900s on property\nProperty has been vandalized/theft issues (tractor stolen, fixtures ripped out)\nPreviously tried to rent out house but renters damaged it\nBoarded it up and left it\nFamily land \u2014 nephew owns adjoining 40 acres\nPrior joint ownership with his sister (deceased); her son now owns the back 40\n-------\nIF a house is present on the property:\nAge: Built early 1900s\nCondition: Vacant, boarded up, heavily vandalized, needs extensive repairs\nStructure: Was livable years ago, now stripped (fixtures, water heater, doors stolen)\nOther items: No mention of square footage or bed/bath count\n-------\n\n1. Why sell now? Paying taxes yearly, property is too far to manage or maintain, and it\u2019s no longer being used.\n\n2. Why haven't they sold before? Tried to list with a real estate agent back around 2008, but the market was bad and it didn\u2019t sell. Gave up afterward.\n\n3. Why not list with a realtor? Past experience with realtor didn\u2019t result in a sale. Seems open to a simpler, direct sale.\n----------\n- What are their future plans if they don\u2019t sell?: Not mentioned, but implied continued tax burden and disuse.\n- Primary decision maker:Bobby Young\n- Other Decision Makers Involved:None (confirmed)\n- Decision Making Process (if applicable):Bobby is the sole decision-maker. He\u2019s cautious and would want a lawyer to handle paperwork.\n-------\n- Price objective (if we don't have yet):$220,000\n-------\n- Timeline:Open. If close to asking, he's willing to move forward\u2014possibly as soon as next week, but wants legal paperwork in order.\n- Seller Response Quality: Strong and detailed. Clear memory and backstory. Responsive and honest.\n- Communication Style:Friendly, cooperative, talkative. Appreciates patience and clarity.\n- Next Steps / Follow-Up:Call back Thursday afternoon with offer and update from research team.\n\n\u2705 [X] HIGH PRIORITY"

I dont need a realtor.\r\n16083442100 06/30/2025 12:16:07 PM EDT\r\nLet me get a few details from you so we can build out an offer.\nCan you tell me more about this property? Is there a road access? Are utilities available? and are you aware of any easements or restrictions?\r\n17608158883 06/30/2025 1:28:00 PM EDT\r\nWhat range are lots going-for per acre these days?\r\n16083442100 06/30/2025 1:41:33 PM EDT\r\nTo be honest, I dont have a firm offer. My manager would be the one to discuss that. We need to conduct a more detailed analysis of your property before we can make a firm offer. It looks like investors in the area are offering between $6,000 and $8,000 per acre for properties like yours. Once our manager reviews your property, we can provide you with a firm offer.\r\n17608158883 06/30/2025 1:53:37 PM EDT\r\n37 acres total.\r\n17608158883 06/30/2025 1:53:40 PM EDT\r\nWe got 5 acres of it zoned as Rural Residential and the rest is Ag.  \r\n16083442100 06/30/2025 2:22:53 PM EDT\r\nI see. Thank you for letting me know. I just want to make sure, youre also the sole owner, right?\r\n17608158883 06/30/2025 3:28:45 PM EDT\r\nYup\r\n16083442100 06/30/2025 3:44:23 PM EDT\r\nGot it. Based on our conversation, Id like to have our manager, Travis to give you a call to discuss an offer. When are you available for a quick call? Mornings or afternoons?",

Zillow shows an EMV of $130K, but he believes that\u2019s low due to wetlands. He won\u2019t consider offers below $150K, citing the good condition of the building, garage, and shed. Subdividing may not be ideal due to wetlands, and STR potential appears neutral. What do you think?"

I think LI AI MV of $123,947 is actually pretty close. I discounted the manual comps by -35% to adjust the price down for flood plain and that came to $117,284.\n\nI like your suggested offer amount of $67,539.17 to start. We can go higher from there if needed, probably into the $80ks. There's a subdivide opp I could look at as well if he's looking for higher than that."
